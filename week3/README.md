# Week 3: Building Real Projects
## 1. Project 1 :
- [ ] Start a project using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Implement a few key features and ensure proper testing with Jest.
## 2. Project 2:
- [ ] Begin another project, but this time focus on Next.js server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG). Implement a blog or e-commerce site and optimize it for performance. Implement user authentication in your Next.js application using a secure authentication library (e.g., NextAuth.js).
